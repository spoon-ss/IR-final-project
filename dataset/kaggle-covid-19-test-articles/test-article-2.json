In this regard, mathematical modeling is an interesting approach that can allow the evaluation of different scenarios, furnishing information for a proper support for health system decisions. In general, nonlinear dynamics of biological and biomedical systems is the objective of several researches that can be based on mathematical modeling or time series analysis (Savi, 2005) . In particular, coronavirus propagation can be described by a mathematical model that allows the nonlinear dynamics analysis, representing different populations related to the phenomenon. Literature presents some examples related to the dynamics of infectious diseases. Different kinds of models can be employed, essentially considering nonlinear governing equations. Rihan et al. (2018) described the dynamics of coronavirus infection in human, establishing interaction among human cells and the virus. Chen et al. (2020) developed a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus considering a simplified version of the bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission model, defined as a reservoir-people model. Results follow the general trend of the initial propagation. Li et al. (2020) estimated characteristics of the epidemiologic time distribution, exploiting some pattern trends of transmission propagation. Riou & Althaus (2020) exploited the pattern of human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Two key parameters are considered: basic reproduction number that defines the infectious propagation; and the individual variation in the number of secondary cases. Uncertainty quantification tools were employed to define the transmission patterns. Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models are an interesting approach to deal with the mathematical modeling of coronavirus transmission. Wu et al. (2020) investigated Wuhan -China case, evaluating nowcasting and forecasting domestic and international spread outbreak. Lin et al. (2020) proposed a model considering individual reaction, governmental action and emigration. The model is based on the original work of He et al. (2013) that proposed a model to describe the 1918 influenza.",

Besides the big difference between both cases, it is clear the huge impact of variations on the transmission rate function that represents governmental and individual actions. It is noticeable that the effective actions tend to reduce the infected population, reducing the final crisis period as well. Nowadays, one of the most relevant issue to be discussed in terms of propagation is the governmental and individual actions. A parametric analysis is of concern considering distinct scenarios related to intervention. Scenarios defined by the variation of the intervention moments is initially treated. The moment of the governmental action start, represented by parameter (1) (day), is analyzed in Figure 11 , considering the following values: 17, 22, 27 and 32 and (2) is assumed to be 20 days after (1) . Note that the delay to the start of the governmental action dramatically alters the response, increasing the number infected population and its duration. The same conclusion can be established considering the second governmental action, represented by (2) (day), presented in Figure 12 that shows the same trend considering a different set of start instants: 37, 42, 47 and 52.
